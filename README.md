# Foodies App Project

## Overview

The Foodies App is a frontend-only web application that allows users to explore nearby restaurants, add items to their cart, and proceed to checkout. This demo project focuses on the user interface and does not include backend functionality or database integration.

## Features

  - Username: `admin@gcet.com`
  - Password: `123`
  - Only these credentials grant access to the application.

- **User Location Tracking:**
  - Upon login, the application prompts the user to provide their location.
  - If location access is granted, the app displays restaurants within a 5 km radius.

- **Ordering System:**
  - Users can browse restaurant menus, add items to their cart, and proceed to checkout.
  - Multiple payment methods are simulated during the checkout process.

- **Frontend Only:**
  - This project focuses solely on frontend development; no backend or database integration has been implemented.
